    "This module will also cover some background material on getting installed on your system, and some other notes on how to use these notebooks.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. How to use Jupyter Notebooks, including Markdown cells and exporting to PDF\n",
    "2. How to complete exercises and check your solutions work with *pytest*\n",
    "3. Python versions, and writing compatible code in both Python 2 and Python 3\n",
    "4. The Altair library for visualisations (we will use this extensively throughout the course)\n",
    "5. Different types of data (discrete and continuous) and how to generate random variables from them.\n",
    "6. Normal distributions, their properties and testing for normality\n",
    "7. Z-scores and moments"

    "**Note:** this method does not install the `maxentropy` package, refer to the last part of the pip instructions below for this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing standalone packages\n",
    "To install a standalone package, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -y LIBRARY_NAME\n",
    "    \n",
    "For instance, to get tensorflow, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -y tensorflow\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can run this command from Jupyter Notebooks too, and if you run many versions of Python on your computer, this helps ensure you have the right environment. Just prepend a `!` and run in a cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "    !conda install -y tensorflow\n",
    "    \n",
    "For `sklearn`, the name of the library is `scikit-learn`. Therefore you would run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    !conda install -y scikit-learn\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "For `altair`, `vega` and `vega_datasets`, you'll need to use the `conda-forge`, which is simply a different repository of libraries than normal. Instead, use:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    !conda install -c conda-forge -y vega vega_datasets altair\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell run, completed, and gave you an execution number, you'll see the message \"Everything is installed!\" printed after the cell. If that's the case, you are free to move onto the next Notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing packages using pip\n",
    "If you've installed Python yourself, you probably know how to install modules for your system. If you are unsure, try: `pip install my_module`\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also find the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `maxentropy` package in `requirements.txt` requires deprecated `sklearn` (updated to `scikit-learn`), so first run `set SKLEARN_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_SKLEARN_PACKAGE_INSTALL=True` before `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Deprecated `sklearn` can then be uninstalled with `pip uninstall sklearn`."
